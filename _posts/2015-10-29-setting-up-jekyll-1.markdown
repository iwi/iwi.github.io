This is my first experience setting up a blog with Jekyll. So far not as 
easy as I expected, but at least something is coming up which is usually a 
pleasant feeling.

Following the github.io instructions was less straight forward than what I
initially thought. And although the Jekyll site is very useful I would have
appreciated a step-by-step how to. That's why I thought I would put one
together for the future. 

I'm still not particularly pleased with the outcome so I will add updates as I
improve it.

1. github.io setup
2. Jekyll installation
3. Theme choice
4. Jekyll set-up
5. voila

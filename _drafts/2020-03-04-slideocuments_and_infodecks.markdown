Here's my little rant about documents that end up written down on slides. 

This is not new. There are a few summaries that date at least as far back as
[2006](https://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2006/04/slideuments_and.html), which talk about the idea of _slideocuments_ and how bad and
inappropriate they are as they're neither good presentations nor good
documents. I recommend [this short note from Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Slideument.html). I like how it
makes a distinction between _slideocuments_ and _infodecks_ which I think helps
separate concerns adequately.

Most of sources I've found are clear in communicating that slides for
presentations are not dicuments and should never be used as such. However, they
don't address the issues _infodecks_ have. This is relevant as _infodecks_ are
more and more prevalent - at least in the world I work.

An _infodeck_ can be defined as a **standalone document** written on
**landscape** formatted **pages** (aka slides), which on top of text, uses
graphics and other **visual devices** (e.g. extreme font types, arrows, boxes,
columns, colouring) to communicate information in a **not necessarily linear**
way (within each slide).

Plenty of the above are problematic when the goal is to communicate information
in an easy to absorb format (hopefully in a format that can be faster to digest
than a _classic document_).

Specifically:

- Pages are only necessary for printing or maybe projecting (on a
    presentation). I personally read most of the documents on a screen: either
    computer or phone, I know a few that choose to read on tablets or
    e-readers, and none of these media require the information to be confined
    within the space of a page. Therefore, paging means assuming that the
    audience will want to read on paper (and accuse/excuse themselves as
    Ludites, ðŸ™„), maybe it's time to save some trees ðŸ™‚.

    - Although a landscape formatting can have some benefits for specific
        visuals, for reading it's clearly suboptimal. It's agreed that very
        long lines are harder to read. To be fair, many _infodecks_ split the
        text in shorter columns which takes me to the next point:
        non-linearity.

        - A non-linear narrative can work in some particular cases or maybe for
            some people, but it puts the pressure on the reader. When a
            document is linear there's an unspoken agreement that you just move
            on downwards starting from the top until you reach a point where it
            has a note suggesting you to skip to a next topic down, or it gets
            to too much detail for you to be interested. Of course this assumes
            that a _classic document_ is well structured, which yes, I know is
            rare. I'm also assuming an _infodeck_ is well structured and I'd
            say that is a bigger assumption as it seldom happens. Many people
            feel entitled by the design freedom that the space of a slide gives
            them. It allows them to be creative, to add pictures so it's 'less
            boring' and more 'alive' (I'm not joking I've heard those exact
            words to describe the addition of images into a document that is
            meant for adults who are professionally interested in the content
            of a document).

            - different language: when using an _infodeck_ instead of a
            _classic document_, we're getting the information in a supposedly
            pre-chewed form that can be fed to us quickly and easily but in
            fact they end up being very difficult to navigate and to extract
            the actual information one needs or utterly simple and not
            containing that necessary information that we were after. We're
            asked to make an extra effort to understand a different language
            which tends to be inconsistent as it's produced by people who are
            usually not good at designing.
            - The combination of pagination, landscape and non-linearity
            exacerbate the siloing of the pages. It's not easy to communicate
            the branching of a concept, sub-sections of a higher level one, and
            other structural devices of a _classic document_. The _slide unit_
            is confined to one page. It could have some goodness if it
            translated into more concise ideas and better summarised
            information but instead it tends to cramp up pages with minuscule
            text.

            - **standalone**: A document is expected to be self contained or to
            refer to other documents occasionally. Doing that in an _infodeck_
            is possible, but difficult and rare. Appendices are an easy device
            to include extra detail in a document. It's a well established way
            to leave some of the content for later and/or for subsets of the
            audience. On a slide in an _infodeck_ adding appendices is hard and
            tends to be badly achieved. There's no unique place to include a
            footnote, and cross-referencing to other parts of the _infodeck_
            tends to be arduous.



Of course I'm not referring to those people that are just lazy and make a few
bullet points that serve no purpose whatsoever, those would produce terrible
documents no matter the format

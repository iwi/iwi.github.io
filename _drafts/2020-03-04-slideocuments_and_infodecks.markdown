# slideocuments and infodecks
Here's my little rant about documents that end up written down on slides. 

This is not new. There are a few summaries that date at least as far back as 2006, which talk about the idea of _slideocuments_ and how bad and inappropriate they are as they're end up being neither good presentations nor good documents. If you want to just read one, I'd recommend this short note from Martin Fowler. It is my favourite as it distinguishes between _slideocuments_ and _infodecks_ which I think is fundamental. 

Most of these pieces are clear in communicating that slides for presentations are not and should never be used as documents. However, they don't address the problems that I think _infodecks_ suffer from. This is relevant as _infodecks_ are more and more prevalent - at least in the world I work.

An _infodeck_ can be defined as a **standalone document** written on **landscape** formatted **pages**, which on top of text, uses graphics and other **visual devices** (e.g. extreme font types, arrows, boxes, columns, colouring) to communicate information in a **not necessarily linear** way (within each page). 

Plenty of the above are problematic when the goal is to communicate information in an easy to absorb format (hopefully in a format that can be faster to digest than a _classic_ document).

**landscape**: I can see some benefit in the wide formatting because most screens are wider than tall. However, from what I have read and from my own experience reading long lines reduces speed and increases the effort required to the reader (a theme which is recurrent). When long lines are avoided the extra width is often used to add non-linearity (which I discuss below). 

**pages**: I personally read most of the documents on a screen, computer or phone, I know a few that choose to read on tablets or e-readers, and none of these require the unit: page. Why then are we assuming that the best way of writing a document is paginated? Some people say they need to print it out (and self-accuse/excuse of being Ludites...). 

**non-linearity**: that's fine for some people, but it puts the pressure on the reader. When a document is linear there's an unspoken agreement that you just move on downwards starting from the top, until you reach a point where it has a note suggesting you to skip down, or it gets to too much detail for you to be interested. Of course this assumes that a 'regular' document is well structured, which yes, is rare. I'm also assuming an _infodeck_ is well structured and I'd say that tends to be even less frequent as many people feel entitled to be creative, to add pictures so it's 'less boring' and more 'alive' (I'm not jocking I've heard those exact words to describe the addition of images into a document that is meant for adults who are professionally interested in the content of a document). 

The combination of pagination, landscape and non-linearity exacerbate the siloing of the pages. It's not easy to communicate the branching of a concept, sub-sections of a higher level one, and other structural devices of a classic document. The _slide unit_ is confined to one page. It could have some goodness if it translated into more concise ideas and better summarised information but instead it tends to cramp up pages with minuscule text. 

**standalone**: A document is expected to be self contained or to refer to other documents occasionally. Doing that in an _infodeck_ is possible, but difficult and rare. Appendices are an easy device to include extra detail in a document. It's a well established way to leave some of the content for later and/or for subsets of the audience. On a slide in an _infodeck_ adding appendices is hard and tends to be badly achieved. There's no unique place to include a footnote, and cross-referencing to other parts of the _infodeck_ tends to be arduous. 

In a nutshell, when using an _infodeck_ instead of a classic document, we're getting the information in a supposedly pre-chewed form that can be fed to us quickly and easily but in fact they end up being very difficult to navigate and to extract the actual information one needs or utterly simple and not containing that necessary information that we were after.

We're asked to make an extra effort to understand a different language which tends to be inconsistent as it's produced by people who are usually not good at designing.

Of course I'm not referring to those people that are just lazy and make a few bullet points that serve no purpose whatsoever, those would produce terrible documents no matter the format.
